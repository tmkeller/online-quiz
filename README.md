## Objectives

Working from scratch, build an online quiz that stores the user's high score between sessions using the localStorage API. This app has the following attributes:

* Persistent storage using localStorage, which enables a list of high scores.
* Single page app with fast, vanilla JS-based pageloads.
* A timer that ends the game prematurely when it runs out, and penalizes the player for wrong answers by deducting time.
* Functions without throwing any errors to the console.
* Easily navigable interface.
* Dark mode for easy viewing.
* Code design allows for easy changes to number of questions, and time limit length.
* Question locations are randomized, making it harder for the user to remember the location of correct answers after taking the test multiple times.
